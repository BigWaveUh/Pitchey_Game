WHAT IS PITCHEY EVEN?

Pitchey is an adorable little AI dog that learns how to escape mazes using Deep Q-Learning! The game features positive and negative reinforcement, real-time environment interaction, and adaptive behavior! I created him because I felt as if many people have not interacted with AI in a more "raw" state. We typically have polished packages like Gemini and ChatGPT. Hopefully you'll find Pitchey fascinating and adorable! And just maybe, I could have sparked your interest in machine learning! Have fun with Pitchey! He's yours to take care of now!
